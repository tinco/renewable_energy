  <h1>About this site</h1>
  <p>
    This site visualizes the total use of energy per person and
    contrast this with the means for production of energy. The style is inspired
    by the book <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/">Sustainable Energy —
    without the hot air<a/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the site is to allow the visitor to explore the full story of
    energy consumption and production supported by actual information sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    For simplicity, when the phrase "energy production" is used it is meant the
    process of collecting energy and transforming it to some form ready for
    storage or transport for consumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the phrase "energy consumption" is used it is meant when energy is
    obtained from storage or transport and transformed into heat, light or motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site regards all forms of energy consumption: direct —transforming stored
    energy into heat, light or motion— and indirect —using a service that is
    enabled by energy consumption—.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insight is provided to what actions in the daily lives of persons result in
    energy consumption, and what impact they have both economically and on
    the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The site regards both sustainable and less sustainable forms of energy
    production.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insight is provided to what ways energy is and can be produced for consumption,
    and what impact those ways have both economically and on the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    All information on this site will be backed up with live links to credible
    sources — be they scientific research, industrial reports,
    investigative journalism, coverage of real life events or surveys.
  </p>

  <p>
    The user of this site will be able to interact with the information to
    experiment or make it reflect their perspective and gain an understanding of
    how energy consumption is a part of their lives, and how energy is or could
    be produced for their use.
