    <div id="transport" class="consumption">
      <h2>Day to day transport</h2>
      <p>
        What modes of transportation do you use during your daily activities such
        as work, school, visiting friends and family, shopping and eating out?
      </p>

      <p>
        On average, citizens of the UK travel 50 kilometers by car per day. This
        roughly equates to an energy consumption of 40kWh/d.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you compare to that number?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="wind" class="production">
      <h2>Wind energy</h2>
      <p>
        Energy can be drawn from the wind through windmills on land, in shallow
        waters and in deep waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we would cover 10% of all land in the UK with wind farms, the wind
        farms would generate about 20kWh/d per person in total.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we would cover all of the shallow waters around Britain with wind farms
        they would generate about 16kWh/d per person.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we would cover all of the deep waters around Britain with wind farms
        they would generate another 32kWh/d per person.
      </p>

      <p>
        What would it cost to build these wind farms? How do they compare to wind
        farms currently existing, how would the landscape look with these farms?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="travel" class="consumption">
      <h2>Long travel</h2>
      <p>
        Airplane travel has become very common, and has a significant energy
        consumption impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        One airplane holiday per year to a destination about 14.000KM away by
        plane costs around 12.000 KWh per passenger, so over a year this amounts
        to 33kWh/d per person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you ever travel long distances? Do you travel by plane, car, bus or
        train?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="solar" class="production">
      <h2>Solar energy</h2>
      <p>
        Energy can be collected from the light that the Sun shines down during
        the day.
      </p>

      <h3>At home</h3>
      <p>
        The simplest and most efficient use of solar energy in cold countries
        is to warm water with it. If everyone would cover 10m2 of their south
        facing roofs with solar water heating panels then on average, this would
        yield about 13kWh/d per person, assuming 50% efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        More expensive and less efficient, but more versatile, is converting
        the Sun's energy to electricity using photovoltaic panels. Theoretically
        the maximum efficiency of photovoltaic panels is 60%, when perfect
        lenses are used, and 45% without lenses. In practice no panels with an
        efficiency exceeding 23% exist in the market, and most panels have are
        about 14% efficient. If we would cover another 10m2 of south facing
        roofs with expensive 20% efficient panels, they would yield another
        5kWh/d per person.
      </p>

      <h3>Solar farms</h3>
      <p>
        We could also use the land available around our cities to collect energy
        from the sun. If we would cover 5% of all land in the UK, or 200m2 per
        person, with 10% efficient panels, that would yield another 50kWh/d per
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option is to cover the land with plants that could be used to
        generate energy, In Europe not many very efficient plants can grow.
        If we would cover 75% of the UK, or 3000m2 per person, with plants that
        generate 0.5W per square meter that would generate an additional 36kWh/d
        per person. This amount of land is equal to the amount of land currently
        reserved for agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's the most efficient plant we could grow in Europe? How much area
        could we reasonably cover with energy generating plants? How many
        photovoltaic panels can you put on your roof? How many would you have
        installed in farms? What are the costs involved?

    <div id="heating" class="consumption">
      <h2>Heating and cooling</h2>
      <p>
        Hot water for bathing, cooking, cleaning is estimated to cost about
        12kWh/d per person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warming the air in the UK is estimated to cost about 24kWh/d per person
        on average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooling air costs significant amounts of energy in countries where
        temperatures regularily exceed 30 degrees celsius. In the UK most
        temperatures rarely exceed 30 degrees, and thus cooling costs are quite
        small. We estimate an average of 1kWh/d per person, which also includes
        the refrigerator and freezer.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much do you spend on heating and/or cooling your home? What
        technology could you use to reduce your energy expenditures?

    <div id="hydro" class="production">
      <h2>Hydro</h2>
      <p>
        Electricity can be generated from locations where rain water collects at
        attitude and can be collected behind dams. The north of the UK has
        enough of this altitude and rainfall to generate about 1.5kWh/d per
        person.
      </p>
      <p>Also includes wave and tide</p>

  <h1>About this site</h1>
  <p>
    This site visualizes the total use of energy per person and
    contrast this with the means for production of energy. The style is inspired
    by the book <a href="https://www.withouthotair.com/">Sustainable Energy —
    without the hot air<a/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the site is to allow the visitor to explore the full story of
    energy consumption and production supported by actual information sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    For simplicity, when the phrase "energy production" is used it is meant the
    process of collecting energy and transforming it to some form ready for
    storage or transport for consumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the phrase "energy consumption" is used it is meant when energy is
    obtained from storage or transport and transformed into heat, light or motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site regards all forms of energy consumption: direct —transforming stored
    energy into heat, light or motion— and indirect —using a service that is
    enabled by energy consumption—.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insight is provided to what actions in the daily lives of persons result in
    energy consumption, and what impact they have both economically and on
    the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The site regards both sustainable and less sustainable forms of energy
    production.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insight is provided to what ways energy is and can be produced for consumption,
    and what impact those ways have both economically and on the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    All information on this site will be backed up with live links to credible
    sources — be they scientific research, industrial reports,
    investigative journalism, coverage of real life events or surveys.
  </p>

  <p>
    The user of this site will be able to interact with the information to
    experiment or make it reflect their perspective and gain an understanding of
    how energy consumption is a part of their lives, and how energy is or could
    be produced for their use.
